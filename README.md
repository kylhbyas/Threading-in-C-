This program approximates pi using the Monte Carlo method. It also keeps track of the time it takes to perform the calculation.

# Program usage
How do we run your program?
* To run the program:
  * Open the program in visual studio and hit the play button
* Does it expect any inputs?
  * The program will prompt the user for 2 integers and then use those numbers to perform the calculation.

# Notes
* What is working?
  * The program is believed to be working as intended.
* What are the limitations of the program?
  * The approximation is not very good unless very large integers were entered but the trade off would be the calculation time would be longer.
  
* What design decisions did you make?
  * Consistency was the primary concern at the time of writting.
